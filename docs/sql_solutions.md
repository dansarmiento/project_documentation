# sql_solutions: Frequently Requested Reports

## Overview

This repository serves as a central location for frequently requested SQL queries and stored procedures.  It aims to improve efficiency and consistency by providing readily available, well-tested solutions for common reporting needs.  This eliminates the need to repeatedly write and debug similar queries, saving developers time and reducing errors.


## Key Features

* **Pre-built SQL Queries:**  A collection of optimized SQL queries for various reporting requirements.
* **Stored Procedures:** Includes stored procedures for more complex operations, offering enhanced performance and reusability.
* **Views:**  Provides pre-defined views to simplify data access and reporting.
* **Business Logic Functions:**  Contains functions encapsulating business logic, ensuring consistent calculations across different queries.  (e.g., `fn_business_days_calculation.sql`)

## Project Structure

The repository is structured simply, with all SQL files stored directly in the root directory:

* `LICENSE`: The project's license file.
* `README.md`: This documentation file.
* `*.sql`:  Individual SQL files containing queries, stored procedures, functions, and views.  File names are descriptive and indicate their purpose (e.g., `vw_appt_kpi_current.sql` is a view related to appointment KPIs).


## Getting Started

To use the SQL queries and stored procedures in this repository, you will need to connect to the appropriate database using a SQL client (e.g., SQL Server Management Studio, DBeaver, pgAdmin).  The specific instructions for connecting will depend on your database system and client.

Once connected, you can execute the SQL files directly. For example, to execute the `vw_appt_kpi_current.sql` view, open the file in your SQL client and execute the SQL code contained within.  The resulting view will then be available for querying.

Remember to replace any placeholder values (e.g., database names, table names) with your specific environment's details before executing the SQL code.  Consult the individual file names and contents for details on their purpose and required parameters.

**Example (using SQL Server Management Studio):**

1. Open SQL Server Management Studio.
2. Connect to your database server.
3. Open the `vw_appt_kpi_current.sql` file.
4. Execute the SQL code within the file.
5. Query the newly created view using a `SELECT` statement:  `SELECT * FROM vw_appt_kpi_current;`


This repository provides a starting point for building upon these reports or creating similar ones.  Remember to always test thoroughly before using these queries in a production environment.
