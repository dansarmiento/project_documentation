# machine_learning_notebooks

This project is a collection of Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating various machine learning techniques and applications.  The notebooks cover a range of topics, from fundamental algorithms to advanced model building and deployment using Spark ML.  This repository serves as a practical learning resource and a showcase of different approaches to common machine learning problems.


## Key Features

* **Comprehensive coverage of machine learning algorithms:** Includes examples of supervised learning (regression, classification), unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction), and neural networks.
* **Real-world datasets and applications:** Notebooks utilize various datasets, addressing diverse problems such as heart failure prediction, mental health analysis, and weather forecasting.
* **Spark ML integration:** Demonstrates the application of machine learning algorithms using Apache Spark for large-scale data processing.
* **Pipeline development:** Examples of creating and using machine learning pipelines for improved efficiency and reproducibility.
* **Model evaluation and comparison:** Notebooks emphasize proper model evaluation techniques, allowing for informed model selection.


## Project Structure

The project is organized into folders based on the type of machine learning technique used:

* **`EDA`:** Exploratory Data Analysis notebooks.
* **`neural_networks`:** Notebooks focused on neural network architectures and training.
* **`pipeline`:** Notebooks demonstrating the creation and use of machine learning pipelines.
* **`spark_ml`:** Notebooks showcasing Spark ML library functionalities.
* **`supervised`:** Notebooks covering various supervised learning algorithms and applications.
* **`unsupervised`:** Notebooks covering various unsupervised learning algorithms and applications.

Individual notebooks within these directories address specific algorithms or applications.  For example, `supervised/logistic_regression_for_classification.ipynb` demonstrates logistic regression for a classification task.


## Getting Started

Each Jupyter Notebook in this repository is self-contained. To run the notebooks, you will need:

1. **Jupyter Notebook:** Install Jupyter Notebook using `pip install notebook`.
2. **Python Libraries:**  Install the necessary Python libraries.  The specific libraries required may vary between notebooks, but common dependencies include `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and potentially `pyspark` for Spark ML notebooks.  You can find the specific requirements by examining the import statements within each notebook.

To run a notebook:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/[YourGitHubUsername]/machine_learning_notebooks.git` (Replace `[YourGitHubUsername]` with the actual username).
2. Navigate to the directory containing the notebook you wish to run.
3. Start Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook`.
4. Open the desired `.ipynb` file in your browser.
5. Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially.

**Note:** Some notebooks may require specific datasets.  Instructions for data acquisition will be provided within those notebooks if necessary.  Ensure you have the necessary data files before running those notebooks.
