# python_analytics_solutions: Jupyter Notebook Solutions for ETL and Data Analytics

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks designed to solve various Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) and data analytics tasks.  The notebooks utilize different technologies like Apache Airflow, SQL Alchemy, Spark ML, and handle diverse data formats and sources.  These solutions are provided as examples and may require adaptation to specific environments and data structures.

## Key Features

* **ETL Processes:**  Multiple notebooks demonstrate ETL workflows for different data sources and formats.
* **Data Analytics:**  Notebooks showcase various data analysis techniques, including feature engineering and machine learning model building.
* **Technology Diversity:**  Leverages Python libraries such as Apache Airflow, SQL Alchemy, and Apache Spark for data processing and analysis.
* **Real-world Examples:** Notebooks address practical data challenges, including updates to various systems (CEMRP, MGMA, Productivity, Provider) and data transformations (XLS to XLSX).
* **Machine Learning:** Notebooks demonstrate the use of Spark ML for building machine learning pipelines (including Logistic Regression).


## Project Structure

The repository is organized with each Jupyter Notebook representing a distinct solution:

* **`.ipynb` files:** Individual Jupyter Notebooks containing ETL and data analytics code.  Examples include `Apache_Airflow_Python.ipynb`, `Spark_ML_Pipeline.ipynb`, and others focused on specific data processing tasks.
* **`apache_spark_hdfs` directory:** (Presumed) This directory likely contains supporting files or data for notebooks utilizing Apache Spark and HDFS.  Further investigation is needed to confirm its contents.
* **`LICENSE` file:** Contains the project's licensing information.
* **`README.md` file:** This file (the current document).


## Getting Started

To use these notebooks, you will need:

1. **Jupyter Notebook:** Install Jupyter Notebook using `pip install notebook`.
2. **Python Libraries:** Install necessary Python libraries based on the notebook's requirements. This will likely include `pandas`, `psycopg2` (or other database connectors), and potentially `pyspark` and `apache-airflow` (or their respective alternatives). Specific library requirements are not explicitly stated in the provided information and will need to be determined by inspecting each individual notebook's code.
3. **Data:** You will need to provide the relevant data sources as specified within each individual Jupyter Notebook.

**Running a Notebook:**

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/<username>/python_analytics_solutions.git` (Replace `<username>` with the actual repository username).
2. Navigate to the cloned directory.
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook`.
4. Open the desired `.ipynb` file from the Jupyter Notebook interface.
5. Execute the code cells sequentially, adapting the code and data paths as needed.

**Example (Conceptual):** To run `Spark_ML_Pipeline.ipynb`, you will likely need to configure Spark, load your data into a Spark DataFrame, and then execute the code within the notebook.  The exact steps depend on the specific code within the notebook itself.

**Note:**  This documentation assumes a basic understanding of Jupyter Notebooks, Python, and the technologies used within the various notebooks.  Detailed instructions for each notebook are best found within the individual notebook files themselves.  The `apache_spark_hdfs` directory's purpose requires further investigation.
