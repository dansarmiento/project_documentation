# `analytics_portfolio` Project Documentation

This repository showcases a collection of data analysis projects demonstrating expertise in full-stack analytics, encompassing ETL processes, statistical analysis, data visualization, and machine learning.  The projects utilize publicly available, de-identified data and highlight a range of skills applicable to diverse analytical challenges.


## Key Features

* **End-to-End Analytics:** Projects cover the entire analytics lifecycle, from data extraction and transformation to model building and visualization.
* **Diverse Technologies:**  Utilizes a variety of tools and technologies including SQL, Python, dbt, BigQuery, various cloud platforms, and machine learning libraries.
* **Healthcare Focus:** Several projects specifically address challenges within the healthcare domain, leveraging data from Electronic Health Records (EHR).
* **Well-Documented Projects:** Each project includes a detailed description, highlighting the methodology, skills used, and results achieved.
* **Reproducible Workflows:** Notebooks are provided to allow for reproducibility and exploration of the analytical processes.


## Project Structure

The repository contains Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb) detailing individual projects and supporting documentation.

* **`.ipynb` files:** These contain the code and analysis for each project.  Specific project titles are descriptive of their contents.
* **`README.md`:** This file provides an overview of the repository and its contents.
* **`LICENSE`:** The license under which the code is distributed.
* **`daniel sarmiento - Epic Certificate Status.pdf`:**  Likely a supporting document unrelated to the core projects.


## Getting Started

Each project within this repository is self-contained and can be run independently.  The following steps provide a general guide to working with the Jupyter Notebooks:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:  `git clone https://github.com/dansarmiento/analytics_portfolio.git`

2. **Install Dependencies:**  Each notebook has specific dependencies. Install them as needed based on the project's requirements and instructions within the notebook itself.  The README provides a general overview of technologies and skills employed across projects (e.g., Python, SQL, dbt, BigQuery, etc.).

3. **Run the Notebooks:** Open the desired `.ipynb` file in a Jupyter Notebook environment.  Follow the instructions within the notebook to execute the code and reproduce the analysis.  Note that some projects (especially those involving cloud services like BigQuery) may require specific configurations and credentials.

4. **Data Access:** Note that the projects often leverage publicly available datasets; however, accessing or replicating certain data sources (like EHR data) might require additional steps and/or appropriate authorization.


**Example (Project 1):** To run the "Building a Scalable E-Commerce Data Warehouse" project, open `dbt_bigquery_in_colab.ipynb`.  You will need to ensure you have a Google Cloud Project configured and have installed the necessary libraries (including the `dbt` package and the appropriate BigQuery client libraries). The notebook will guide you through the steps.


This documentation provides a high-level overview.  For detailed instructions and specific requirements, refer to the individual project notebooks and their accompanying descriptions within the `README.md` file.
