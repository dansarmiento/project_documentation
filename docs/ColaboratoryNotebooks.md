# ColaboratoryNotebooks Project Documentation

## Overview

This project, `ColaboratoryNotebooks`, contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating various data analysis techniques using Google Colaboratory.  The notebooks cover a range of topics, from basic statistical analysis and feature engineering to more advanced machine learning models, showcasing practical applications of data analysis within the Google Colab environment.


## Key Features

* **Variety of Data Analysis Techniques:**  The notebooks demonstrate a wide array of techniques, including linear regression (simple and multiple), logistic regression, Naive Bayes, ARIMA modeling, time series analysis with FBProphet, and deep learning using Keras and TensorFlow.
* **Real-world Dataset Applications:**  Multiple notebooks utilize real-world datasets for practical demonstrations, covering diverse areas like healthcare (CMS data), sports (water polo statistics), and potentially others indicated by the file names.
* **Comprehensive Feature Engineering Examples:**  Several notebooks are dedicated to feature engineering, a crucial aspect of effective data analysis.
* **Data Visualization:**  Notebooks utilize libraries like Plotly for creating interactive visualizations.
* **Google Colaboratory Integration:**  All notebooks are designed to run seamlessly within Google Colaboratory.


## Project Structure

The project is primarily organized with individual Jupyter Notebook files (.ipynb). The notebooks are directly in the root directory, with a subset also contained within the `notebooks` directory.  Key files and directories include:

* **`/` (Root Directory):** Contains the majority of Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating various data analysis techniques.
* **`notebooks/`:** A subdirectory containing additional Jupyter Notebooks.
* **`README.md`:** This documentation file.
* **`LICENSE`:**  The project license.


## Getting Started

To use these notebooks, follow these steps:

1. **Access Google Colaboratory:** Go to [colab.research.google.com](colab.research.google.com).
2. **Create a New Notebook:** Click "New Notebook" to create a new, blank Jupyter Notebook.
3. **Upload Notebooks:**  Upload the desired `.ipynb` file(s) from this repository into your Colab environment. You can do this by clicking "Files" on the left sidebar and then "Upload".
4. **Run the Notebooks:** Open the uploaded notebook and run each code cell sequentially using the "Play" button or Shift+Enter keyboard shortcut.  Make sure to install any necessary libraries as indicated within the notebook itself (e.g., `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `tensorflow`, `plotly`).

**Example (Illustrative):**  Most notebooks will begin by importing necessary libraries and loading data.  A typical cell might look like this:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
# ... other imports ...

data = pd.read_csv("data.csv") # Replace "data.csv" with the actual filename
# ... rest of the notebook code ...
```

Remember that each notebook is self-contained and may require specific data files or libraries to be installed and imported. Consult the individual notebooks for detailed instructions and dependencies.
